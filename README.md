# AQI-India
This Git repo contains a Python-based analysis of India's AQI data sourced from the CPCB. 
It includes code and datasets covering the period 1990 to 2022. The project uses pandas, NumPy, seaborn, and matplotlib for data preprocessing, EDA, and data visualization. The analysis focuses on PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and O3 pollutants and their spatial and temporal patterns across different regions in India.
